Assingment of variables
a = 10
b = 30
c = a + b

Printing
print a
print a b c
print "Value of a is" a "Value of b is" b "Sum of both of them is" c

Conditionals
if a > b
    print "a is greater than b"
elif a < b
    print "b is greater than a"
else
    print "a and b are equal"

Looping
i = 0
while i < 5
    print i
    i = i+1

Cpp code injection
cpp{
    for(int i = 0; i<5; i++){
        cout << "Value of i is " << i << endl;
    }
}

Cpp libraries include method
includes{
    #inlcude <iostream>
}
